# Style-Transfer Print/Scan
This repository describes the complementary material for the paper: "Generating Automatically Print/Scan Textures for Morphing Attack Detection Applications". This process focuses on simulating the handcrafted print/scan texture used to create print/scan version images automatically from bona fide examples. This scenario allows us to train in single and differential morphing Attacks. 

This repository describes the Transfer-style method-based GANs using a PyTorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix implementation
- Paper under revision process.

# Pre-requisite
- Linux
- Python 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

# Getting Started
- Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
cd pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
```
- Install PyTorch and 0.4+ and other dependencies (e.g., torchvision, visdom)
- For pip users, please type the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
- For Conda users, you can create a new Conda environment using conda env create -f environment.yml.

# Pre-trained models
  - Downloading (Soon)
  - Paper under revision process.

# Generate your own PS600 images:
- Pix2pix
- CycleGAN
```
python test.py --dataroot datasets/face/testA --name CycleGANps600-noflip-pixel --model test --no_dropout  
```
The option --model test is used to generate results of CycleGAN only for one side. This option will automatically set --dataset_mode single, which only loads the images from one set. On the contrary, using --model cycle_gan requires loading and generating results in both directions, which is sometimes unnecessary. The results will be saved at ./results/. Use --results_dir {directory_path_to_save_result} to specify the results directory.

For pix2pix and your own models, you need to explicitly specify --netG, --norm, --no_dropout to match the generator architecture of the trained model.
